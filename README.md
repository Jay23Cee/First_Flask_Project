My First Flask Project
using the "Learn Flask for Python tutorial on youtube" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA)

Making some CSS adjustment. 
Added a Grid.

Will work to improve UI. 
make it a responsible website.

probably include Sass to help in that area.

Things that can improve.
Add more details to the first page.

The "UPDATE" page needs an upgrade.


the current front page can become a second page later. (Will need a better front page.)
